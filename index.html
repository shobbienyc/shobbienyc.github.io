                <p>Dear family and friends,</p>
                <p>Due to the continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic, we’ve decided to again postpone our wedding. We’re very sad about this, but we just don’t see how it’s possible to move forward with our plans for a big celebration in September. </p>
                <p>Instead, we’re going to elope this fall, and then hold the reception in Brooklyn as planned as soon as it’s safe to gather again. We’re so excited to celebrate with all of you as soon as we’re able, and we hope to be able to share more details about that soon. We’ll continue posting updates on our wedding website: shobbie.nyc. </p>
                <p>We’re so sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you all. If you’ve already made travel arrangements and are having difficulty cancelling them, please reach out to us and we can put you in touch with someone who can help. </p>
                <p>Love, <br>
                Shay and Robbie </p>
